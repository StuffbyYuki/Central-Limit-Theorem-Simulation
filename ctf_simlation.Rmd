##### Simply put, central limit theorem says that sample means are normally distributed if you take enough number of them, no matter what distribution the population has (as long as the mean can be calculated from the population distribution). 

***Change the number of sample means to take to see how that changes the resulting distribution.***
```{r}
# Central limit theorem simulation 
set.seed(0) 

# Create an empty vector
clt <- NULL 

# Sample size for each sample
n <- 10

# Population - Uniform distribution
p <- runif(50)

# Number of sample means to take
n_means <- 1000

# Calculate 
for (i in 1:n_means) {
  clt = c(clt, mean(sample(p, n, replace = T)))
}

# Visualize the simulation result
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(clt, breaks = 50, main = 'Histogram of Means', col = 'beige')
plot(density(clt), main = 'Density Plot', col = 'red')

```
