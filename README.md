# Central-Limit-Theorem-Simulation
You can test and see how Central Limit Theorem actually works in code.

Simply put, central limit theorem says that sample means are normally distributed if you take enough number of them, no matter what distribution the population has (as long as the mean can be calculated from the population distribution). 

***In the R code, change the number of sample means and sample size to see how that changes the resulting distribution.***
