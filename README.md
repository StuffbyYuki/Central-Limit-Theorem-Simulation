# Central-Limit-Theorem-Simulation
You can test and see how Central Limit Theorem actually works in code.

Simply put, central limit theorem says that sample means become normally distributed as the sample size increases, no matter what distribution the samples are coming from (as long as the mean can be calculated from the population distribution). 

***In the R code, change the sample size to see how that changes the resulting distribution.***
